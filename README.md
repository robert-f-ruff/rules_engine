# Rules Engine
The Rules Engine evaluates a series of rules against a set of data. Each rule has a set of criteria, that defines when a rule is applicable, and a series of actions, that define what the engine should do. The engine evaluates the criteria and then executes the appropriate actions.

Users use a web page to define the rules evaluated by the engine. They select one or more pre-defined criterion and action. Each action is customizable by specifying parameters for it. The rule is then stored in a database. Software developers use an administrator console to define each criterion and action.

# System Design
This project is a two-tier system. The first tier is a SQL database, run in MySQL, that stores the data that comprises the rules evaluated by the engine. The second tier, or frontend, is a python webserver that uses the Django framework to generate the web pages that end users interact with.

# Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate my knowledge of modern programming languages and system design. Reading a book and completing an online certification gave me a good starting point on my reskilling journey, but creating a system from scratch has locked that knowledge in and exposed me to problems and issues that never came up while completing fill-in-the-blank assignments.

# Setup
The Rules Engine is hosted in a series of Docker containers. To build and start the engine locally:
1. Configure a local or remote instance of MySQL:
   1. Create a dedicated user account for the rules engine. You may choose any user name and set a password for the user.
   2. Create two databases:
      ```SQL
      CREATE DATABASE rules CHARACTER SET utf8;
      CREATE DATABASE test_rules CHARACTER SET utf8;
      ```
   3. Assign permissions to the user you created in step 1i:
       ```SQL
       GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, DROP, REFERENCES, INDEX, ALTER ON rules.* TO <user>@<host>;
       GRANT ALL ON test_rules.* TO <user>@<host>;
       ```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace `<user>` with the user name and `<host>` with the name of the MySQL server.
2. Edit the `rules_engine/docker.env` file by filling in values for the environment variables (do not enclose values in double quotes):
   1. Add a secret key, which is a randomized sequence of printable ASCII characters, of your choosing. One suggestion to generate the secret key is to use [GRCâ€™s Ultra High Security Password Generator](https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm).
   ```Dockerfile
   SECRET_KEY=
   ```
   2. Enter the MySQL username and password of the user you created in step 1i.
   ```Dockerfile
   MYSQL_USER=
   MYSQL_PASSWORD=
   ```
   3. Enter the address where the MySQL instance is located.
   ```Dockerfile
   MYSQL_HOST=
   ```
3. Make the `rules_engine/build.sh` and `rules_engine/initialize.sh` files executable:
   ```Shell
   cd rules_engine
   chmod u+x build.sh initialize.sh
   ```
4. Build and start the Docker containers:
   ```Shell
   ./build.sh
   ```
